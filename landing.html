            >A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of
            instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. It's used to
            write software programs and applications, and to control and
            manipulate computer systems. There are many different programming
            languages, each with its own syntax, structure, and set of commands.
            Some of the most commonly used programming languages include Java,
            Python, C++, JavaScript, and C#. The choice of programming language
            depends on the specific requirements of a project, including the
            platform being used, the intended audience, and the desired outcome.
            Programming languages continue to evolve and change over time, with
            new languages being developed and older ones being updated to meet
            changing needs.</em

            would love to use? Are you passionate enough to take the big step to
            enter the world of programming? Then you are in the right place
            because through this article you will get a brief introduction to
            programming. Now before we understand what programming is, you must
            know what is a computer. A computer is a device that can accept
            human instruction, processes it, and responds to it or a computer is
            a computational device that is used to process the data under the
            control of a computer program. Program is a sequence of instruction
            along with data.

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
            ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
            model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
            sites still in their infancy.

            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
            the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
            humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
            believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you
            need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
            middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend
            to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
